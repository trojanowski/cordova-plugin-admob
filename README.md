## Important Notice ##

This plugin will NOT be evolved any more, please use the pro version instead. The totoally re-designed **[AdMob PluginPro](https://github.com/floatinghotpot/cordova-admob-pro)** is proved much better and more than welcome by Cordova APP/game developers. 

As announced by Cordova team, the plugins registry is being migrated to npm, you can find [all plugins by Raymond here](https://www.npmjs.com/~floatinghotpot).
